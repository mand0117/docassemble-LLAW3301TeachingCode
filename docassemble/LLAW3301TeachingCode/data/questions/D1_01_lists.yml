question: Variables
mandatory: True
subquestion: |
  Here are our different lists.
  
  **MJFname** is a regular Python list.  We can display it using Mako:
  
  `${ MJFname }`
  
  **MJFname2** was declared using `variable name`.  It's a DAList which means
  we have access to some additional *methods*, such as displaying the length
  of the list in words:
  
  MJFname2 has **${ MJFname2.number_as_word() }** items.
  
  and displaying its items in a more readable way:
  
  MJFname2's elements are: *${ MJFname2.comma_and_list() }*
  
  **MJFname3** is declared as a `DAList` using an `object` block.  That means
  we also get access to the DAList goodness.
  
  MJFname3 has **${ MJFname3.number_as_word() }** items

  MJFname3's elements are: *${ MJFname3.comma_and_list() }*

code: |
  # We add items by appending them
  MJFname3.append('Fuller Doodoo')
  MJFname3.append('Star Veeng')
  MJFname3.append('Gotha Goe')
  
  # When we finish adding items to our list, we must include these
  # two lines.
  MJFname3.there_are_any = False
  MJFname3.there_is_another = False
---
# Define a python list in a code block.  This is the simplest way
# but we lose soem of the DAList goodies so we won't usually use this

  MJFname = [
    'Ida Noe',
